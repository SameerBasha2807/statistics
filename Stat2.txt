Q1.The three measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.

Q2.
 mean:
Definition: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
Use: The mean is used when you want to determine the overall average of the dataset. It’s most effective with data that is symmetrically distributed without outliers.
Example: For the dataset [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the mean is (2+3+4+5+6)/5 = 4.
Median:

Definition: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
Use: The median is useful when the data is skewed or contains outliers, as it is less affected by extreme values.
Example: For the dataset [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the median is 4.
Mode:

Definition: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
Use: The mode is used when you want to identify the most common value in a dataset. It is particularly useful for categorical data.
Example: For the dataset [2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6], the mode is 4.
Q3.

The median is the average of the 8th and 9th values:

​

Mode:
The mode is 177, as it appears most frequently in the dataset.

Q4. 
The standard deviation calculation involves several steps:

Calculate the mean (
𝜇
μ) of the data.
Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result.
Calculate the mean of these squared differences.
Take the square root of the result from step 3 to get the standard deviation.
I'll calculate it for you:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

data = [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]
mean = np.mean(data)
squared_diffs = [(x - mean) ** 2 for x in data]
variance = np.mean(squared_diffs)
std_dev = np.sqrt(variance)
std_dev

Q5. Range:

Definition: The difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.
Example: In a dataset of ages 
[
10
,
12
,
14
,
16
,
18
]
[10,12,14,16,18], the range is 
18
−
10
=
8
18−10=8.
Use: The range gives a quick sense of the spread but doesn’t consider how the data is distributed between the extremes.
Variance:

Definition: The average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
Example: In a dataset of 
[
2
,
4
,
4
,
4
,
5
,
5
,
7
,
9
]
[2,4,4,4,5,5,7,9], the variance measures how much each number varies from the mean.
Use: Variance provides a more precise measure of spread by considering all data points, not just the extremes.
Standard Deviation:

Definition: The square root of the variance.
Example: If the variance in a dataset is 4, the standard deviation is 2.
Use: Standard deviation is used more frequently than variance because it is in the same units as the data, making it easier to interpret.

Q6. A Venn diagram is a visual tool used to show the relationships between different sets. It consists of overlapping circles, with each circle representing a set. The areas where the circles overlap represent elements that are common to the sets, while the non-overlapping areas represent elements that are unique to each set.

}
A⋃B={0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}

Q8.
Skewness refers to the asymmetry in the distribution of data. If the data is not symmetrically distributed, it is said to be skewed. There are two types of skewness:

Positive (Right) Skewness: The tail on the right side is longer or fatter, meaning the bulk of the data is on the left.
Negative (Left) Skewness: The tail on the left side is longer or fatter, meaning the bulk of the data is on the right.

Q9. 
In a right-skewed distribution, the mean is usually greater than the median. The mean is pulled in the direction of the long tail on the right side.

Q10. 

Definition: Covariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables. If the covariance is positive, the variables tend to increase together; if negative, one variable tends to decrease as the other increases.
Use: Covariance gives a sense of how two variables move together but does not standardize the relationship, making it difficult to interpret the strength of the relationship.
Correlation:

Definition: Correlation standardizes covariance to a value between -1 and 1, making it easier to interpret. A correlation of 1 means a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 means a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 means no linear relationship.
Use: Correlation is commonly used in statistical analysis to determine the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.

Q11.
 The sample mean (
𝑥
ˉ
x
ˉ
 ) is calculated as:
𝑥
ˉ
=
∑
𝑖
=
1
𝑛
𝑥
𝑖
𝑛
x
ˉ
 = 
n
∑ 
i=1
n
​
 x

​
 
​
 
where 
𝑥
𝑖
x 
i
​
  are the individual sample observations, and 
𝑛
n is the number of observations.

Example: For the dataset 
[
2
,
4
,
6
,
8
,
10
]
[2,4,6,8,10], the sample mean is:
𝑥

=
2

6

+

Q12. 
For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.

Q13. Covariance measures the direction of the relationship between two variables but does not standardize the relationship, making it harder to compare across different datasets.
Correlation standardizes the relationship between two variables, making it easier to compare across different datasets.

Q14.Central Tendency: Outliers can significantly affect the mean by pulling it towards the outlier, but they have less impact on the median and mode.

Example: In the dataset 
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
100
]
[1,2,3,4,100], the mean is 22, but the median is 3, showing how the outlier (100) skews the mean.
Dispersion: Outliers increase the range, variance, and standard deviation, as these measures are sensitive to extreme values.

Example: Adding an outlier to the dataset 
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
]
[1,2,3,4] to get 
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
100
]
[1,2,3,4,100] drastically increases the standard deviation from 1.12 to 39.2.
